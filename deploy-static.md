# Deploy Your Wayzata DECA Website as Static Site

Your website IS designed to work as a static site. Here's how to deploy it:

## Option 1: Download and Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Download your project files**
   - Click the three dots menu in Replit
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the files on your computer

2. **Build the static files**
   - Open terminal in your project folder
   - Run: `npm install`
   - Run: `npm run build` (this creates the static files in the `dist` folder)

3. **Deploy to hosting service**
   - Upload the `dist` folder contents to:
     - Netlify (drag and drop the dist folder)
     - Vercel (connect your GitHub repo)
     - GitHub Pages
     - Any static hosting service

## Option 2: Direct File Upload

If the build process fails, you can use the raw files:

1. Upload these folders to your hosting service:
   - `client/src` (your React components)
   - `client/public` (your HTML files)
   - The `index.html` in the root

2. Most modern hosting services will automatically build React apps

## What Works in Static Deployment:

✅ Teacher login system (uses localStorage)
✅ Event management and calendar
✅ Contact forms (Web3Forms integration)
✅ All navigation and pages
✅ Responsive design
✅ All styling and animations

## Your Web3Forms Setup:
- API Key: `fd1929ef-7f8d-4551-ae99-45aa464c1c33`
- Email: `wayzata.deca@gmail.com`
- This will continue working in static deployment

The website will work perfectly once properly deployed to a static hosting service.
